## Description

Quarto is a board game invented by Blaise Muller and published by Gigamic.

This is a game for two players. The board has 16 squares (4x4), and 16 different pieces that can be constructed combinating the following four characteristics:

* Size (big/small)
* Colour (red/blue)
* Shape (circle/ square)
* Hole (piece with hole/piece without hole)

For our 2D version we use ringed/unringed instaed of big/small just to hopefully ease pieces characteristics differentiation

## Objective

The aim of the game is to complete a line with four pieces that share one of the characteristics (four ringed pieces, four unringed, four dark, four light, four circle, four square, four with hole or four without hole). The line may be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. The winner is the player who places the fourth piece of the line.

## Turns

Players move alternatively, placing one piece on the board; once inserted, pieces cannot be moved.

One of the special characteristics of this game is that the choice of the piece to be placed on the board is not made by the same player who places it; it is the opponent who decides which will be the next piece to place.
So, each turn consists of two actions:

1. Place on the board the piece given by the opponent.
2. Give to the opponent a new piece to be placed in the next move.

## Final

The game finishes in a draw when nobody reaches the objective after placing the 16 pieces.
